# 💱 Currency Converter (USD to INR)

A simple Flutter application that converts US Dollars (USD) to Indian Rupees (INR).

This project was built as my first Flutter app to understand and practice the basic concepts of Flutter such as widgets, layouts, state handling, and user input.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Project

The main goal of this project is learning, not complexity.

Through this app, I learned:
- Flutter project structure
- Stateless vs Stateful widgets
- TextField for user input
- Button interaction
- Basic state management using `setState`
- Simple UI design using Flutter widgets

> 💡 Note:
